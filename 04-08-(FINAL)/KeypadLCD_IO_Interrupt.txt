This code serves as an introduction to interrupts on the PIC in C.

This program executes an infinite loop which causes the first line of the 
character LCD to cycle between "Chocoloate?" and "CHOCOLATE?!". When a key is
pressed on the keypad, the character corresponding to the key will be printed on
the LCD.

This is achieved using RB1's "interrupt on change" feature.
